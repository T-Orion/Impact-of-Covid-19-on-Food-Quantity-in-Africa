# Impact of Covid-19 on Food Quantity in Africa

Covid-19 provides a unique opportunity of a clear inflection point that was experienced (more-or-less) in parallel across the African continent, and which impacted multiple key aspects of daily life.

In this project, Tolu (the client) is interested in understanding what impact Covid-19 had across Africa on each of the following.  This paper refers: [Here](https://www.cambridge-africa.cam.ac.uk/cambridge-africa-updates/sentiment-and-opinion-analysis-of-public-space-physical-activity-in-lagos-during-lockdown-a-data-driven-approach-to-developing-context-aware-public-health-messaging-to-reduce-disease-vulnerability-and-improve-covid-19-control)

The change in the availability of food  due to supply chains being affected, or change in the price of food and resulting hunger /food poverty/food insecurity. N.B. For both food quality and quantity, it would also be helpful to note which types of actors generated these mentions (e.g. general population, government, NGO, private sector) and a comparison of the magnitude and sentiments associated with these mentions across categories of actors. E.g were industry actors more likely to mention food quality (magnitude)? Were NGO actors more likely to speak positively about healthier food ? etc 

### Goal is to help the client by using the CRISP-DM methodology:

*  At the outset (for the 1st internal touchpoint). 1st draft of the Ghost deck for the interim-present back - what you found, based on which data and and how you want to proceed with the detailed analysis. List out who will do what - divide up the team to take up different roles.  Consider the data, modelling, visualization and reporting sides of the question.  Consider nominating a single person who is responsible for keeping the team on-schedule. Make sure you understand the business question being asked - prepare a list of questions to ask.  Initial exploration of the data will help you in achieving this.

* Gather initial data around the question assigned to your group - as much as possible in each of the pre-COVID, COVID-lockdown and post-COVID situations.  Being creative here will be important and will drive a lot of your success.  Consider how to gather data which isnâ€™t too biased to a few countries, despite Twitter data being inherently biased to specific countries, how to look for enough keywords and hashtags to get a sufficiently representative sample and look for other corroborating data to inform and add to the information that you have gathered
* Understand and explore the initial data and use it to develop your model and strategy
* Develop a first client touchpoint (10-15 slide presentation, could include a link to a dashboard or other useful online materials), where initial findings, data overview and a strategy for completing the analysis are all presented.  This should also include questions for the client that could include Clarifications, Presenting major issues and asking client for input, Asking client to prioritize between competing priorities, and Presenting assumptions.
* Integrate client feedback into your week 2 plan.
* Final report should include a clear statement of what you do and do not know, based on which data, and in which confidence interval.  Listing out next steps for further work and further research.
